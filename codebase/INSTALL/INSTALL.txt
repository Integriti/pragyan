1) Make sure the FollowSymLinks feature is included in the Options directive of the <Directory "..."> corresponding to your install location.
	For this,
	a) Go the configuration directory of your web server. (Usually, it is named httpd.conf, check your web server documentation to find it's location)
	b) Search for the <Directory "..."> directive which includes the location where you will install the CMS
	c) Search for the line containing the "Options" directive. (It's just a line starting with the word "Options")
	d) Make sure it has either "All", or "FollowSymLinks" included in the list of included features.
	 
2) Unzip the source code in the root of your http server or from wherever you want to serve up the site.

3) Open INSTALL/install.php from your browser and follow the instructions.
   
4) Done!

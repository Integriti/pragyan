Version 1
---------

    This project is inspired by Parijat Mukherjee's Pragyan CMS v1. It was his
    idea to create a CMS to be used for the NIT Trichy's and Pragyan's website
    (Pragyan is the annual international techno-management festival of NIT Trichy).
    Hence, the name "Pragyan CMS". <http://www.nitt.edu>,<http://www.pragyan.org>
    Pragyan CMS v2 was created to make up for the shortcomings of Pragyan CMS v1.

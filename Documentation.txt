Requirements :

  * PHP
      + You need PHP 4.2.0 or newer, with session support (see FAQ 1.31)
      + You need GD2 support in PHP to display inline thumbnails of JPEGs
        ("image/jpeg: inline") with their original aspect ratio
      + You need PHP 4.3.0 or newer to use the "text/plain: external"
        MIME-based transformation
      + When using the "cookie" authentication method, the mcrypt extension is
        strongly suggested for most users and is required for 64?bit machines.
        Not using mcrypt will cause phpMyAdmin to load pages significantly
        slower.
  * MySQL 3.23.32 or newer (details);
  * Web browser with cookies enabled.

Introduction :

phpMyAdmin can manage a whole MySQL server (needs a super-user) as well as a
single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need a properly set up MySQL
user who can read/write only the desired database. It's up to you to look up
the appropriate part in the MySQL manual.

Features :

  * Multi-user open source content management system
  * Used to organize and facilitate collaborative content creation and updation
  * Handy tools to manage permissions for groups and users
  * Modules article, gallery, quiz,	form and forum

Installation :
See INSTALL/INSTALL

Original Credits of Version 1
-----------------------------

    This work is based on Parijat Mukherjee's Pragyan CMS v1. It was his idea
    to create a web-based interface to MySQL using PHP4. Although I have not
    used any of his source-code, there are some concepts I've borrowed from
    him. Pragyan CMS v2 was created to make up for the shortcomings of 
    Pragyan CMS v1.

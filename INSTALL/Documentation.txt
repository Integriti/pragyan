Original Credits of Version 1
-----------------------------

    This work is based on Parijat Mukherjee's Pragyan CMS v1. It was his idea
    to create a web-based interface to MySQL using PHP4. Although I have not
    used any of his source-code, there are some concepts I've borrowed from
    him. Pragyan CMS v2 was created to make up for the shortcomings of 
    Pragyan CMS v1.

1) Unzip the source code in the root of your http server or from wherever you want to serve up the site.

2) Create a database "pragyan" in your mysql.

3) Create a new user in mysql and give it all the permissions over the above created database.

4) Update the config.inc.php inside cms folder to reflect the following:
	CMS_TITLE -> the title that will come on each page
	MYSQL_SERVER -> "localhost" OR the i.p. no. of your mysql server or name of your mysql server

	// defining the username to connect to the database.
	define("MYSQL_USERNAME","username");

	// defining the password used to connect to the database.
	define("MYSQL_PASSWORD","password");

	// defining the name of the database to connect to.
	define("MYSQL_DATABASE","pragyan");

5) Import the mysql database by using the following command
		mysql -u username -p pragyan<pragyan.sql

6) Change the ownership of the uploads folder to apache(or the user running the http server).
   Make sure apache has complete permissions over the uploads folder.
	chown -R apache:apache uploads
	chmod -R 755 apache uploads

7) Change the following lines in the .htaccess file present at the same level as the index.php

	Assuming you have put up the CMS in pragyan folder of your server root, i.e, if the absolute path is
		/var/www/html/pragyan

	Then change the following lines in .htaccess to

		RewriteBase     /pragyan
		RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}      ^/pragyan/$

8) Now login with the following username and password
	username:admin@pragyan.sf.net
	password:admin
